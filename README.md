Back-End : "Django"
Django version : 2.2
preffered to run this build on Windows and not in ubuntu as it only supports Django versions upto 1.12.

Front-End : "React" (open any other framework. Although it is a library.)

Asyn design patterns:
jquery library will be used throughout to carry out AJAX calls. Try sticking to Jquery to  maintain uniformity in the code and fastens debugging.
plus it is something new to learn.

Other JavaScript include :
1) Jquery
2) Charts.JS

CSS:
1) Bootstrap4
